## **Types of Prompt Engineering**

**Zero-Shot Learning:**  This involves giving the AI a task without any prior 
examples. You describe what you want in detail, assuming the AI has no prior 
knowledge of the task

**One-Shot Learning:** You provide one example along with your prompt. This 
helps the AI understand the context or format youʼre expecting.

**Few-Shot Learning:** This involves providing a few examples (usually 25 to 
help the AI understand the pattern or style of the response youʼre looking for.

**Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Here, you ask the AI to detail its thought 
process step-by-step. This is particularly useful for complex reasoning tasks.

**Iterative Prompting:** This is a process where you refine your prompt based 
on the outputs you get, slowly guiding the AI to the desired answer or style of 
answer.

**Negative Prompting:** In this method, you tell the AI what not to do. For 
instance, you might specify that you donʼt want a certain type of content in the 
response.

**Hybrid Prompting:** Combining different methods, like few-shot with chain-of
thought, to get more precise or creative outputs.

**Prompt Chaining:** Breaking down a complex task into smaller prompts and 
then chaining the outputs together to form a final response.
